# Background


## Status COINS 2.0
COINS 2.0 has been replaced by the international norm ISO 21597 Information Container for Data Delivery (ICDD) and the Dutch norm NEN 2660. COINS 2.0 is still in use in the Netherlands, as ICDD has not been fully implemented yet in all ontology's or applications.

## COINS version 2.0
Version 2.0 is available sinces 7 april 2016. Complementary an API (Application Programming Interface) and a COINS Navigator are available. The objective of the COINS Navigator is aimed primarily as a demonstration tool. As a result it performs well with small containers, however, because its architecture as an in-memory application, its use for importing large containers is strongly discouraged.
